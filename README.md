## UserAuth

This web app includes a sign-in, sign-up feature, along with the social media app authorisation including LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, Google.

User will be only able to enter into the site when he/she is sign-in. Otherwise, it will redirect back to the login page, where the user has the feature of sign-in and sign-up. 

When the user creates a new account, then everything will be going to save into the database, and it will help in authenticating while sign in whether user credentials are present.

You can also view the registered user via the admin panel. And while login with any social app, it will going to look for the unique user. It can also retrieve user information including first name, last name & email-id, and it will going to store into the database as the login happens.
