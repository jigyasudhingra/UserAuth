## UserAuth

This web app includes a sign-in, sign-up feature, along with the social media app authorisation including LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, Google.

When the user creates a new account, then everything will be going to save into the database, and it will help in authenticating while sign in whether user credentials are present.

You can also view the registered user via the admin panel.
